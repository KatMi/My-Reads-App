# MyReads Project

This React application is created for the Udacity Frond-End Developer Nanodegree programme. It allows users to keep track of the books they are currently reading, want to read or have already read by assigning them to apropriate shelves. User can search additional books by clicking on the plus sign in the bottom right corner of the home page.

## Run the App

* Clone or download this repository
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
